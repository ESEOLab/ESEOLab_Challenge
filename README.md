## How to use

### Be careful
Please, before pushing your code, be sure that you are in the right branch. The master branch (main) is the one that will be used for the evaluation.
So, please, do not push your code in the master branch. You can create a new branch and push your code in it. Then, you can create a pull request to merge your branch with the master branch.
